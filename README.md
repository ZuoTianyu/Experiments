# Experiments
This repository contains three python files: OfflineAlgorithmN.py, OnlinePrediction.py and experiment.py.

OfflineAlgorithmN.py is used to calculate the optimal offline cost of a request sequence. The inputs of function are arrival times and local servers of the requests, and the transfer cost.

OnlinePrediction.py is used to calulate the cost of request sequence generated by online algorithm. The inputs of function are arrival times and local servers of the requests, the hyperparameter $\alpha$, prediction accuracy and the transfer cost.

experiment.py is used to conduct experiment on real data access traces. It computes the online-to-offline ratio of request sequence, under difference combinations of hyperparameter and prediction accuracy. And some surface diagrams with respect to different transfer costs will also be generated, as an output of this program. Since this file invokes the functions in OfflineAlgorithmN.py and OnlinePrediction.py, you should run these two files before using experiment.py.

We use real data traces to conduct the experiment, which is stored in 'IBMObjectStore2.txt' of the folder 'data'. And the output surface diagrams are stored in the folder 'Figure'.
